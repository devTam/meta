              Our product solves crucial problems of such giant services as
              Foursquare & Swarm, Groupon, and Tripadvisor. Millenial travelers
              don't possess any more countless hours for preparing the trip
              itinerary (reading Tripadvisor). Business travellers, in
              particular, complain they are having maximum 2 to 5 free hours
              during their work trips, which they don't want to spend on
              researching what is worth doing around.

              The technology uses decentralized consensus to maintain the
              network, which means it is not centrally controlled by a bank,
              corporation, or government. In fact, the larger the network grows
              and becomes increasingly decentralized, the more secure it
              becomes.
